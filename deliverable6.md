# 1. Introduction

```
Our system provides an auction house over the web for students to buy and sell
products for school faster and locally. Instead of visiting multiple sites users can login
with a registered account and start browsing the auction house. If a user is not in the
database they will be required to register with valid information. Once on the main page,
the user will find a search bar and options to narrow their search via category and
subcategory. If the user chooses to buy they can either bid or choose buyout (buy now
option). If the user wants to sell then they can submit an item as an auction by providing
enough details for the item to be valid.

# 4. Code Quality

```
Readable ​: was our code easy to follow along and explain to other programmers.
If help was required was the code clean enough to understand how they built their base.
We choose to make our code easy to read, instead of writing a bunch of clarifying
comments.
```
```
Functionality ​: We talked a lot about what functions worked best that we created and
which ones in libraries would suit our needs. If possible, we chose to use functions in
libraries.
```

```
Naming Conventions: ​Most of our variable/class names follow the camelCase naming
convention. Our names are always multiple characters and real words (instead of single
character names).
```
```
Separation of Concerns: ​This is admittedly easy to do with web pages, but we have
each distinct need of our program separated. Our login, registration, product, and home
pages each have their own code files unique to them.
```
```
In addition to the above, we would regularly send code between each other on a regular
basis to make modifications and general improvements.
```
# 5. Lesson learned

```
PHP: ​ We learned that coding to insert and retrieve data via online was harder than
expected. We noticed that a local database can react differently than an online database
with a web server. In the future, we need to set aside more time to test PHP in order to
account for this.
```
```
HTML/CSS: ​ we learned that although some aesthetic features look or do some cool
things, it may cause issues with trying to get certain functionalities to work. We also
learned that it is better to iterate on an interface than just keep one.
