# 1.Introduction: ​U Auction is an auction house that allows users to buy and sell

textbooks between each other, unlike traditional university bookstores our product
allows users to set the price of how much they are willing to pay for their textbooks. The
application would allow students to sell to one another using price points decided upon
by the students.

# 2.Implemented requirements:

```
● Requirements that were implemented was the front end UI for the main
site, as well as the login page to verify and register new users. (Ian) (nick
● Java back end framework was connected to the website backend to assist
in data management. (colton)
● Organization for the project’s readme, licensing, and code of conduct
(Josh)
● Database inception (Nick)
```
# 3.Adopted technologies:

```
● Spring.io framework: used to connect java back end code to work with
front end designs.
● MySQL: used to manage database implementation in the web application.
● HTML/CSS: are used to design the visual end of the site and set up the
initial stages of the front end of the auction house.
● Javascript: is used to code in the front end of the auction house.
● Node.js Server: used to host our website and allow us to test everything
on a centralized server.
```
# 4.Learning/training:

```
● To learn how to appropriately use the spring.io framework, I first tested a
simple hello world program using it on my own computer, then when I had
the program working and displaying on my localhost, I moved the
framework files to the web server to be installed there, where I had to
install the Java JDK and reconnect the JAVA_HOME path similar to my
own machine. From there it was about figuring out re-defining the domain
target in the web framework files to accept the new framework.
```
# 5.Deployment:


# https://overgrowngarden.net/

We are deploying the system through the internet as a website. We are building it to be
able to facilitate simple transactions for users and understand that web development of
this system as a website is a lucrative and easy way to achieve that. Because the
system in production is already accessible online, packaging it in a container and using
docker seems unnecessary for a web project like this. We will, however, still research
these tools for future use as they are invaluable tools for general application production.

# 6.Licensing

The license that we adopted for our source code is the MIT license. We chose
this license because it is short, simple and permissive. We do not feel we need an
overly restrictive or complex license for a class project.

# 8.Look & feel:

## Login:​ We created a login page for our users that already have an account. If the user

has no account stored, they will click the Register link. This will then ask them to provide
some information to create an account (Register).


# Register:​ ​When the user needs to create an account they will be asked for their name,

password, password confirmation, and email. This page will check if the fields are
empty, it will also check if the password and the password confirmation match. If they
are invalid then the user will be notified.

## Main Page: ​After logging in, the user will see the main page, where they are able to

view a variety of products (currently we are just using placeholder images and names
for the products). We also have a search box with a dropdown selector for users to find
the exact product they are looking for.


# 9.Lessons learned:

We learned that communicating between other files and services takes some
troubleshooting, but we had hypothesized this before. We also try to avoid using php
but this could not be avoided due to connections with mysql database and phpmyadmin.
We plan to clean up connections between files and services. We also plan to add more
features or methods to make our program complete. Currently our software just has the
minimum needed systems, and we hope to flesh out those systems in the future.
