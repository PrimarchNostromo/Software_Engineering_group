Introduction

Our project will be an auction house for college students. The purpose of the auction house is for college students to be able to buy and sell textbooks. The problem that this software would solve is students paying too much money on college textbooks, as well as students being unable to resell their books.

Initial Value Proposition and Consumer Segment

We want the students to realize that we will make buying and selling easier than other providers will. We will allow more features and payment methods for those who wish it. Especially for those in a rush after graduation when they need an easy way to get rid of excess materials/supplies.

**Questions:**

 How do you go about buying books and other school supplies?

What are some benefits and downsides you see in buying supplies online?

Would a Web App designed to limit the places you visit for school supplies be useful?

Would a UI designed to be an auction house for students grab your attention?

Would this type of UI take you away from where you shop now?

**Name of interviewee:** Keil Hubbard

**Name of interviewer:** Nick Bollone

**Date:** 2/13/2020

**Response:**

**       ** Keil does not feel like this app will take him away from where he currently gets his supplies, specifically where he gets his books. He did like the U.I. because it is visually pleasing and easy to navigate. Even when explaining the features we could add, he still did not believe that he would switch from his original sources that he buys his supplies. Keilar conclude that he would be among the &#39;Don&#39;t Care&#39; candidates.

**Name of Interviewee:** Zachary Miller

**Name of interviewer:** Joshua Geyer

**Date:** 2/15/2020

**Response:** Zach says that he currently purchases his textbooks from his university bookstore, and he finds buying books from a bookstore more convenient than waiting to get books shipped from online sites. He said that he would be interested in using the app for selling books, especially if the app could facilitate transactions between people in the same university, removing the necessity for shipping. However, he would have no interest in using the software to buy books. He said that UI would not play a major role in his decision to use the product. I would conclude Zach as a &#39;Nice to Have&#39; candidate.

**Name of Interviewee:** Tito Pimentel

**Name of interviewer:** Colton Barboro

**Date:** 2/15/2020

**Response:**

 Tito felt that this application would very much be considered as a primary default when it comes to buying textbooks and supplies. He believes that the localized buying and selling of books by people who have taken classes would mitigate confusion of the version of book needed. He liked the UI concepts, saying it looked easy and simple to navigate and search, with a critique that we should strive to keep empty space on the UI to a minimum. When asked how likely he would select this option of shopping for supplies, he said that he would strongly consider it, a notable quote being &quot;A bitch likes a deal.&quot; I can conclude that Tito would be considered as a &quot;Need it&quot; candidate for the software.

**Name of Interviewee:** Griffin Barboro

**Name of interviewer:** Colton Barboro

**Date:** 2/15/2020

**Response:**

**       ** Griffin was interested in the concept UI when introduced. He said that he would like it clean and not &quot;amateurish&quot; in that he thinks the concept UI looks &quot;dated&quot; and reminds him of a &quot;Windows 95&quot; format. When asked about his book buying process Griffin said that his college has a well working system in place that allows him to buy his books from the school&#39;s book store at reasonable prices, spending little time searching for the books. If he can&#39;t find them there then the teachers typically provide reputable sites to buy them. Griffin has not considered using any third party sites to buy books at a reduced or &quot;free&quot; price. If he were to use a third party site, he wants them to be verified as a quality service and secure. He is interested in the localized buying and selling focus of the application. As a final note he said that he would &quot;consider it&quot; were it to become a product. I believe I will categorize Griffin as a &quot;Nice to Have&quot; candidate.

**Name of Interviewee:** Wilson Laufer

**Name of interviewer:** Ian McIlrath

**Date:** 2/16/2020

**Response:**

 Wilson doesn&#39;t feel like he would use a web app to get his school supplies, but is open to the idea of it being a local auction house. The suggested UI was definitely an issue, as he said the layout doesn&#39;t seem appealing, and looks more like a government website than a profiting company. He said that realistically, he wouldn&#39;t use the product because he already has methods of obtaining what he needs through bigger platforms like ebay. He would be categorized as &quot;Don&#39;t Care&quot;.

**Name of interviewee:** Nick Fisher

**Name of Interviewer:** Nick Bollone

**Date:** 2/14/2020

**Response:**

**   ** Nick felt like there was to many places to buy from including the school bookstore for this to be useful. Since websites like facebook also provide resources to buy and sell that another app or website was not really necessary. He also thought the UI could use a little work for average people. He did say that maybe with some changes and added features that the UI would be very nice. Also that instead of targeting Universities, change the target to meet corporate demands. Nick would be a &#39;Nice to Have&#39; candidate.
