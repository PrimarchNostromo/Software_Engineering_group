# Software_Engineering_group

This is the general repository for the Auction House Group. Our project is an online-based auction house primarily designed for students to be able to buy and sell products between each other. Our product allows users to set the price of how much they are willing to buy. The application would also allow users to sell to one another using price points decided upon by the other users. It uses a database to store and manage all the products on the auction house.

## Getting Started
