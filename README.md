# Software_Engineering_group

This is the general repository for the U Auction software engineering project. Our project is an online-based auction house primarily designed for students to be able to buy and sell products between each other. Our product allows users to set the price of how much they are willing to buy. The application would also allow users to sell to one another using price points decided upon by the other users. It uses a database to store and manage all the products on the auction house.

## Getting Started

There is no software needed, everything can be accessed through the website. The website can be found here: https://overgrowngarden.net/


## Deployment

We deploy our project through a website rather than through containers. Because the system in production is already accessible online, packaging it in a container and using docker seems unnecessary for a web project like this. 

## Technologies Used

* Spring.io framework: used to connect java back end code to work with front end designs.
* MySQL: used to manage database implementation in the web application.
* HTML/CSS: are used to design the visual end of the site and set up the initial stages of the front end of the auction     house.
* Javascript: is used to code in the front end of the auction house.
* Node.js Server: used to host our website and allow us to test everything on a centralized server.
